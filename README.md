# tetragonsidekick

The Tetragonsidekick project is a Kubernetes operator designed to process logs emitted by Tetragon pods, enhance the logs using an LLM (Large Language Model), and forward them to an OpenSearch server for future analysis. This project uses Redpands as the central data platform for event streaming, ensuring scalability and real-time processing.

## About The Project

### Key Features

- **Log Streaming**: Captures logs from Tetragon pods in the `kube-system` namespace and streams them into a Redpanda topic.
- **Protobuf Serialization**: Processes Tetragon logs using the official `events.proto` definitions.
- **Event Enhancement**: Uses an LLM (e.g., OpenAI GPT-4) to analyze and enhance events.
- **OpenSearch Integration**: Forward enhanced logs to OpenSearch for indexing and analytics.
- **Scalable Architecture**: Built on Redpanda for efficient and scalable data processing.

### Architecture Overview

1. **Tetragon Pods**:
   1. Emit structured logs in protobuf format.
2. **Custom Kubernetes Controller**:
   1. Captures logs from Tetragon pods.
   2. Serializes logs using Tetragonâ€™s protobuf definitions.
   3. Streams logs to Redpands.
3. **Stream Processor**:
   1. Enhances logs using an LLM.
   2. Writes enhanced logs back to a separate Redpands topic.
4. **OpenSearch Sink**:
   1. Consumes enhanced logs from Redpands.
   2. Indexes them in OpenSearch.

#### Event Structure

The official Tetragon [protobuf](https://github.com/cilium/tetragon/blob/main/api/v1/tetragon/events.proto) for events provides a structured way to work with Tetragon logs. By leveraging this, you can deserialize and process events effectively, ensuring compatibility with Tetragon's data structure. Below is a detailed implementation plan using the protobuf definitions and integrating Redpands for a data-driven architecture. Sample [event.json](./assets/event.json).

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

1. Kubernetes Cluster: A running Kubernetes cluster (v1.29 or higher).
   1. Linux kernel >= 4.19 (for eBPF)
2. Redpands: Installed in the cluster.
3. OpenSearch: Running in the cluster or externally.
4. Operator SDK: Installed on your development machine.
5. Protobuf Compiler: `protoc` must be installed.
